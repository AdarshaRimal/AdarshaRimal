## About Me

I am a dedicated Computer Science student with a love for mathematics that has been with me since childhood. I have a strong interest in **Computer Vision** and enjoy working with tools like OpenCV for object and face detection. While I don't have extensive knowledge of machine learning, my enthusiasm for AI drives me to explore and learn more about it. I am also skilled in **Python** and enjoy creating GUI applications using Tkinter. Currently, I am learning Django to enhance my backend web development skills.
